# What changed in each version

## 0.5.0

**Windows**
- larperCord now runs on Windows 10 and 11, built from the same code.
- Tokens stay in Windows Credential Manager.

**Updates**
- Checks for a new version when opening or from Settings → Updates.
- One button downloads, installs and restarts. Updates are signed, and a version without the right signature isn't installed.
- Restart button in Settings, and this page.

**Voice**
- Microphone noise suppression with RNNoise, on by default and switchable mid-call. It doesn't run with the push-to-talk key released.
- Less stutter and no more clicks when packets are lost or arrive out of order; the audio buffer grows when the network hiccups.
- People no longer cut out for a moment when someone joins or leaves the call.

**Layout**
- Drag the edge of the channel list, the member list or the panes of a split view to resize them. A double-click goes back to the theme's width, and your choice is saved and follows you between themes.
- A narrow conversation keeps working: the search box steps aside before the buttons do.

**Messages**
- A BOT tag next to the name of bots and webhooks, with a check mark for verified bots, in messages, the member list, DMs and profiles.
- Webhook messages keep the name and picture each one was sent with.
- Bot messages in the newer component format, which used to appear blank. Forwarded messages and polls appear as cards.
- Text in embeds can be selected and copied.
- Discord markdown: headings, small text, quotes, lists and `[text](url)` links. Line numbers in code blocks.
- Selecting text inside a code block is visible now.
- Esc cancels editing a message.
- Optional code diagnostics while typing a code block, from a language server you choose.

**Servers and groups**
- Edit a server (name, description, icon, banner) or a group DM (name, icon).
- Delete threads.
- Server banners at the top of the channel list and on invite cards.
- Click a server banner to see it in full, and the same for a profile banner. Server and user menus can open the icon or picture too.
- Friends, group and pin icons redrawn.

**Lighter**
- Smaller executable, faster opening and less memory.

## 0.4.0

First public version: real Discord connection, voice with end-to-end encryption, threads and forums, read state, search, Lua plugins and 11 themes.
